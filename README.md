# Wingent Is Your Wingman: The Dating App That Really Knows You

## 💡 Our Concept In 8 Points

### *Wingman calls*

1. **Through regular calls from their Wingman, the user builds their profile.**
   - Calls are generated through a “conversation pipeline” that keeps them “engaging and to the point.”
   - If you don’t talk to your Wingman you don’t get matches, and you have a weaker profile.
   - Regular calls from your Wingman ensures user retention (much like a streak), which as a consequence resolves into revenue via subscriptions.
   - There are many monetization methods to explore.

2. **“Curated selection”: Your Wingman learns about you, and uses this data to select the right matches.**

### *“Delegate dating agents” / ”Digital twins”*
	
3. **This data is also used to generate “delegate dating agents”** that talk to each other to generate “simulated conversations between potential matches.” The Wingman evaluates these conversations to reach a “conclusion and summary” and “makes a recommendation.”
   - Delegate agents mimick personality traits, conversation style, user's knowledge, etc.
   - It even suggests a first-date proposal.

5. The user-facing app presents these conversations to the user through the industry-established **swiping interface**. The user can further ask questions to the agents. And decides whether to **approve of the match** or not. If they both approve, they get connected.

### *General facts*

6. Our pipeline eventually requires the entire {Tech: Berlin} toolchain:
   - **Mistral** for the LLMs.
   - **LMNT** for TTS.
   - **Haystack** for searching through generated agent profiles and conversation transcripts.
   - **Weaviate** for storing and digesting the user’s semantic information.
   
   
7. We leverage AI agents to stand at **the forefront of the inevitable future of people-connecting software**. 

8. It is mainly an **AI-voice application**, since the Wingman is a voice-enabled interface: you talk to your Wingman; your Wingman is your digital pal that's helping you out. That is our brand.

9. We guarantee privacy through **end-to-end data confidentiality**.
